Description: Bayesian penalized regressions for non-stationary Gaussian linear mixed effects model (Diggle et al. 2015). Specifically, it assumes integrated brownian motion for W as stochastic process. Returns posterior estimates and credible intervals.  It additionally contains functions for diagnostic checks of posteriro samples such as tracing plots,etc.
